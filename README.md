# Unreal Box Open Source Plan 🎮

> This is the official open source repository of Unreal Box. We're exploring what content would be valuable to share with the community.

**[中文版](README_zh.md)**

## 🤔 What We're Considering to Open Source...

As an Unreal Engine asset management tool, we have some standalone modules and utilities that could benefit the community. Here are the directions we're exploring:

---

### 📦 Candidate Open Source Projects

#### 1. uasset Parser Library
- **Description**: Pure JavaScript implementation of .uasset / .umap file parser
- **Features**: Extract asset metadata, name tables, import/export tables, property data
- **Support**: UE4 / UE5 (including 5.3+ new structures)
- **Value**: Enables Web and Node.js developers to read Unreal asset information

#### 2. Blueprint Renderer 🆕
- **Description**: Pure JavaScript implementation of Unreal Blueprint visual renderer
- **Features**: Render blueprint node data into visual graphics
- **Use Cases**: Display, share, and document blueprint logic on the web
- **Value**: View blueprint structure without opening the UE Editor

#### 3. UnrealAgentLink Plugin (TBD)
- **Description**: Bridge plugin between Unreal Editor and external applications
- **Features**: Bi-directional communication, asset import/export, project state sync
- **Consideration**: Need to evaluate core functionality dependencies

#### 4. Asset Classification Rules
- **Description**: Classification and filter rule sets for Unreal asset types
- **Content**: Asset class name mappings, translations, keyword matching
- **Format**: JSON / TypeScript configuration

#### 5. Utility Script Collection
- **Content**: Thumbnail generation, asset batch processing, file monitoring scripts
- **Languages**: Python / Node.js

#### 6. Documentation and Tutorials
- **UE asset management best practices**
- **uasset file format research notes**
- **Developer resources and references**
